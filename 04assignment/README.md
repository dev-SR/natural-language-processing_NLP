## Load Data

### Processing file - test codes


```python
with open('38943-0.txt', 'r') as target_file:
	for num, line in enumerate(target_file.readlines()):
		if "Title" in line:
			title = line.split(":")[1].strip()
			print(title)
		if "Author" in line:
			author_name = line.split(":")[1].strip()
			print(author_name)
author_list = [author_name]*5
author_list

    'is beneath it, and through logical inference with what is above it, and finally with itself by rational consideration or direct intuition. Of these kinds of knowledge the surest and the most deserving of preference is knowledge of oneâs self. When human knowledge attempts to go farther than this, it proves itself to be limited in many ways. Therefore one must not philosophize straight away about questions like the origin or the eternity of the world, but make his first essays with what is simpler. And only through renunciation of the world, and righteous conduct, does the soul lift itself gradually up to the pure knowledge of the Highest.â 5. After secular instruction in Grammar, Poetry and History, and after religious education and doctrine, philosophic study should begin with the mathematical branches. Here everything is set forth in Neo-Pythagorean and Indian fashion. Not only numbers but even the letters of the alphabet are employed in childish trifling. It was particularly convenient for the Brethren that the number of letters in the Arabic alphabet is 28, or 4 multiplied by 7. Instead of proceeding according to practical and real points of view, they give the rein to fancy in all the sciences, in accordance with grammatical analogies and relations of numbers. Their Arithmetic does not investigate Number as such, but rather its significance. No search is made for any more suitable mode of expressing number in the case of phenomena; but things are themselves explained in accordance with the system of numbers. The Theory of number is Divine wisdom, and is above Things, for things are only formed after the pattern of numbers. The absolute principle of all existence and thought is the number One. The science of number, therefore, is found at the beginning, middle, and end of all philosophy. Geometry, with its figures addressing the eye, serves merely to make it more easily understood by beginners, but Arithmetic alone'

## Split the data into training and test sets



```python
# Split into X/y
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split, cross_val_score

x = df["documents"]
y = df["label"]
print(x.shape)
print(y.shape)
x_train, x_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
    x, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=0)

print(x_train.shape)

## Convert text features to numeric



```python
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
# sublinear_df=True, use a logarithmic form for frequency

# cv2 = TfidfVectorizer(ngram_range=(1, 2))  # 82.5%


cv2 = TfidfVectorizer(sublinear_tf=True, min_df=10, norm='l2',
                      ngram_range=(1, 2), stop_words='english')


# min_df is the minimum numbers of documents a word must be present in to be kept
# norm is set to l2, to ensure all our feature vectors have a euclidian norm of 1

X_traincv = cv2.fit_transform(x_train)
x_testcv = cv2.transform(x_test)
print(X_traincv.toarray())

## Train the model


```python

mnb.fit(X_traincv, y_train)

    he has given it the attention which the subject demands as a part of the history of the country. It would be a difficult matter to get at the first American sailor, or to even guess when he existed, but that our continent was once well populated, and that its prehistoric inhabitants sailed the lakes and seas as well as trod the land, is a matter of certainty. Later, when America became known to Europeans, the new comers found Indians well provided with excellent canoes, built of bark or fashioned from logs, but they were "near shore" sailors. The author quotes one instance where a deep sea voyage was undertaken by them in the early days of the English settlers. Certain Carolina Indians, he says, wearied of the white man's sinful ways in trade, thought themselves able to deal direct with the consumers across the "Big Sea Water." So they built several large canoes and loading these with furs and tobacco paddled straight out to sea bound for England. But their ignorance of navigation speedily got the best of their valor. They were never heard of more. The early white navigators of our waters can hardly be considered American sailors. The new found continent was to them of value only for what could be brought away from them in treasure or in merchantable produce, and it was only when an actual and permanent colonization began that a race of native-born sailors was developed on the Atlantic coasts. OLD CONCORD: HER HIGHWAYS AND BYWAYS. Ill. By Margaret Sidney. Boston: D. Lothrop Co. Price $3.00. Of all the books of the year there is not one which carries within it such an aroma of peculiar delight as this series of sketches and descriptions of the highways and byways of that most picturesque of towns, Old Concord. Concord is like no other place in New England. There may be other places as beautiful in their way; there are others, perhaps, of more importance in the Commonwealth, and we know there are hundreds of places where there is more active life to the square foot, but with all these admissions Concord still remains a place of special charm, the result and consequence of more causes than we care to analyze. Its picturesqueness and a certain quaintness of the village has always been noticed by visitors, no matter from
